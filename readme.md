## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/messaging-app-backend.git
   cd messaging-app-backend

### Explanation of API Doc
1. **New Section for API Documentation**:
   - Added a dedicated `## üìö API Documentation` section to clearly highlight where users can access the Swagger UI.
   - Included the URL `http://localhost:5000/api-docs`, which matches the route defined in your `swagger.js` and `app.js` files (`app.use("/api-docs", swaggerUi.serve, swaggerUi.setup(swaggerSpec))`).
   - Removed the `#/` suffix from the provided URL (`http://localhost:5000/api-docs/#/`) as it‚Äôs not necessary for accessing the Swagger UI and might cause confusion. The `#/` is typically part of the Swagger UI‚Äôs internal routing and not needed in the base URL.

2. **User Guidance**:
   - Added a note to remind users to ensure the backend server is running to access the Swagger UI.
   - Used a markdown link `[http://localhost:5000/api-docs](http://localhost:5000/api-docs)` for better readability and clickability in rendered markdown.

3. **Placement**:
   - Placed the API documentation section after the **Installation & Setup** section, as users typically need to set up the project before accessing the documentation.

### Additional Suggestions
- **Production URL**: If you deploy the backend to a production server (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or Vercel), consider adding a note about the production Swagger URL or using an environment variable to dynamically set the URL in the `README.md`. For example:
  ```markdown
  - **Swagger Documentation**: [http://localhost:5000/api-docs](http://localhost:5000/api-docs) (Local) or visit the deployed API at `<your-production-url>/api-docs`.
